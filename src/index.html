        <p>
          Neil Younger is a laid-back tribute project dedicated to celebrating the timeless music of Neil Young. Fronted by Siôn Dawson, we bring together a rotating lineup of talented musicians who share a deep appreciation for Neil’s iconic sound. Whether it’s the soulful strumming of acoustic guitars, the raw edge of electric solos, or heartfelt harmonies, we aim to recreate the essence of Neil Young while adding our own unique twist.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project is more than just a band—it’s a passion-driven celebration of one of the greatest songwriters of all time. From full-scale gigs to intimate jams, Neil Younger delivers a nostalgic yet fresh vibe, perfect for anyone who loves Neil Young’s music as much as we do. Our performances are all about connecting with audiences through music that feels authentic, relaxed, and full of heart.

          Don’t miss our <strong>Lockdown Jams</strong>—a series of collaborative performances created remotely during the pandemic. These jams brought together musicians from across the globe to produce something truly special, proving that even in isolation, music can bring people together. It’s one of the coolest things we’ve ever done, and we’re proud to share it with you.

        <p>
          During the quiet of lockdown, we created something truly special. Our <strong>Lockdown Jams</strong> are a raw and real celebration of music, born out of a time when collaboration felt more important than ever. Working remotely from our own homes, we managed to capture the essence of live performances, proving that music has the power to connect us even in isolation.
        </p>
        <p>
          These jams are more than just recordings—they’re a testament to creativity and the joy of making music together, even when apart. From heartfelt classics like <em>Old Man</em> to the electric energy of <em>Powderfinger</em>, each track carries its own story, infused with the spirit of Neil Young and the unique vibe of our tribute project.
        </p>
        <p>
          Check them out and experience the vibe for yourself. Whether you're a lifelong Neil Young fan or just discovering his music, our Lockdown Jams are a reminder of what music can do in tough times.
