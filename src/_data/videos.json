      "description": "The very first lockdown jam we recorded, Mansion On The Hill from Neil Young’s Ragged Glory, set the tone for what became a unique and rewarding project. Capturing the raw, rugged Crazy Horse sound while working remotely from our own homes was no small feat, but somehow, we managed to create a live vibe that feels authentic to the original. We still remember how surreal it was piecing everything together—each of us recording in isolation yet somehow syncing up as if we were in the same room. This jam holds a special place for us, marking the start of something truly creative during those unusual times.",

      "description": "This is the one we’re most proud of. Words is such a complex yet beautifully simple song, and we managed to capture the essence of a true jam despite working in isolation. Every part of this song feels lyrical to us—the intertwining bass, guitar, piano, and vocals all support each other without stepping on one another. It’s a perfect balance, and every time we listen to Neil’s version on Harvest, we discover something new.<br><br>We were incredibly lucky to collaborate with musicians from The Lockdown Jams project for this one. The keys player brought a stunning layer of depth to the arrangement, and the backing vocalist added multiple lines that truly elevated the performance, making it something special. What’s even more incredible is that we never met or even spoke over video—just texting back and forth to create something magical. We decided to upload this one through The Lockdown Jams YouTube account, thinking it would get more views, and it’s a decision we’re glad we made.",

      "description": "This one was created as a heartfelt gift for a friend’s 70th birthday, and it turned into something really special. For Old Man, we drifted slightly from the pure tribute approach and added strings, which brought a fresh yet fitting touch to the arrangement. We were lucky to have both a banjo player and a pedal steel player on board, which kept the original vibe intact while adding a touch of warmth and intimacy.<br><br>We also collaborated with musicians from The Lockdown Jams project for this one. The keys player contributed beautifully to the arrangement, helping to create a rich, layered sound. Like Words, this was another track we uploaded through The Lockdown Jams YouTube account, and the result was a heartfelt tribute to one of Neil Young’s most beloved songs.",

      "description": "Powderfinger was a fun one to make, even if it was a bit experimental. We decided to use a vintage mic for the vocals, which gave it a raw, slightly unpredictable edge. Darren, our guitarist, had his dog wander into the recording session at one point, which added a bit of humor to the process. The thumbnail image for this jam was actually taken by a band member’s wife, and we even borrowed a rifle from a father-in-law in the US for a bit of extra authenticity—it felt fitting for the song’s story.<br><br>While this one was a bit of an experiment, it was a great experience, and the end result still carries that Neil Young spirit.",
